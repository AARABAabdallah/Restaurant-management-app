# Restaurant-management-app

This app, created with JAVA SE, is an app that allows restaurant management where we find three sort of users : 
- Admin
- Chef
- Storekeeper

It's a french app, so you will find the documentation and the code written in french.
We used NetBeans as an IDE, and it's recommended to be used so that you'll benifit from all the features of the app.
We used ORACLE DATABASE 11g enterprise edition as a database. And as an IDE we have worked with sqldevelopper.
